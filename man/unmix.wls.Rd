\title{Unmix Using Weighted Least Squares}
\usage{
unmix.wls(raw.data, spectra, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw.data}{Expression data from raw fcs files. Cells in rows and
detectors (raw channels) in columns. Columns should be fluorescent data only
and must match the columns in spectra.}

\item{spectra}{Spectral signatures of fluorophores, normalized between 0
and 1, with fluorophores in rows and detectors (channels) in columns.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of weights (one per fluorescent
detector). Default is \code{NULL}, in which case weighting will be done by
channel mean intensities.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing unnmixed data with cells in rows and
fluorophores in columns.
}
\description{
This function performs unmixing of raw data using weighted least squares,
AKA WLS, based on the provided spectra. Weighting is by channel power.
